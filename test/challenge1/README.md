This is a straightforward challenge! To solve it:

1. Call the `registerTeam` function with:
   - Any non-empty string as the team name
   - A team size between 1 and 4

Example solution:
```solidity
challenge.registerTeam("My Team", 2);
```

That's it! The contract will store your team information and mint the flag NFT to your address.

Why this works:
- The name is non-empty, satisfying the first require check
- The team size (2) is between 1 and 4, satisfying the second require check
- The function will automatically mint the flag NFT to your address

Congratulations on getting your first flag! ðŸŽ‰
