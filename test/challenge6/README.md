# Challenge 6: Meet all the conditions

In this challenge, you need to satisfy multiple conditions including contract interface requirements and precise gas control!

## Contract Overview
The contract requires:
1. A correct code based on the current count
2. Your contract must implement `name()` returning a specific string
3. The remaining gas must be within a specific range (190,000-200,000)

## Hints
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
The code is calculated by shifting the count left by 8 bits (<code>count << 8</code>)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Your contract needs to implement the <code>IContract6Solution</code> interface with the exact name string
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
You can control initial gas by specifying it in the function call
</details>

## Solution

1. Create a contract implementing the interface:
<code>
contract Solution is IContract6Solution {
    function name() external pure returns (string memory) {
        return "BG CTF Challenge 6 Solution";
    }

    function attack(Challenge6 challenge6) external {
        uint256 code = challenge6.count() << 8;
        challenge6.mintFlag{ gas: 200_000 }(code);
    }
}
</code>

2. The solution works because:
   - We implement the required interface
   - We calculate the correct code
   - We specify exact gas amount in the call

Congratulations! You've mastered interface implementation and gas control! ðŸŽ‰

Remember: Gas control is a crucial aspect of Ethereum development, affecting both security and optimization. Understanding how to manipulate and control gas usage is an essential skill!
